# PCM_RR: A Reduced Reference Metric for Visual Quality Evaluation of Point Cloud Contents

Reduced reference metrics aim to predict the visual quality of the transmitted contents, while requiring only a small set of features to be sent in addition to the streamed media. In this repository, we provide a reduced reference metric to predict the quality of point cloud contents under compression distortions. The proposed metric relies on a small set of statistical features that is extracted from the reference point cloud in the geometry, color and normal vector domain, which can be used at the receiver side to assess the visual degradation of the content.
